  ![Badge for GitHub repo top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/acoleman37/readme-creator?style=flat&logo=appveyor)

  ## Description
  
  The project will help a user generate a README without having to worry about applying proper mark down syntax. This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.
